**Keylogger**

This Python script is a keylogger that records keystrokes and saves them in a file or sends them via email to a specified email address. It uses the 'keyboard' library to detect key events and 'smtplib' to send emails via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

**Usage**

The script can be used to monitor keystrokes on your own computer or to keep track of someone else's activities (with their consent). It can be run in the terminal with the command 'python keylogger.py' or using any other method to execute Python scripts.

**Functionality**

The keylogger records keystrokes, including special keys like ENTER and SPACE, and saves them to a file or sends them via email. The keystrokes are recorded at a specified interval (default is every 60 seconds) and the log file is named according to the start and end times of the recording session. The email address and password for sending emails must be specified in the code, as well as the report method (either "email" or "file").

**Security**

Using this script without consent is illegal and unethical. It is important to use this script only for lawful purposes, and to inform any users of the computer that their activity is being monitored. The email address and password should also be kept secure, and the log files should be deleted after use.
