This Python code uses the pynput library to log all the keyboard inputs and writes them into a file named key_log.txt. The script records all the key presses, including spaces, enter keys, and any other keys on the keyboard, and saves them into the file.

The code creates a new session in the file every time the code is run. If the file already exists, it will append the new session to the existing file. The code will terminate when the user presses the esc key, which will trigger the on_release function to return False.

The on_release function is called every time a key is released, and it converts the pressed key to a string and writes it to the file. If the key pressed is the esc key, the function will return False, and the program will terminate.

Note that the purpose of keylogger programs is often to monitor and record user activities without their knowledge or consent, which is illegal in many countries. Therefore, you should use this code only for educational purposes or with the explicit permission of the user being monitored.
